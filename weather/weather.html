       			 <p> This project is hosted on a raspberry pi with apache2 as web server. This project was created by a student with student exam code 10010, and is the final assignment in the subject IDG1100.
        		Here I have extracted information from  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_of_Norway'>Wikipedia</a> table, and used bash scripting to extract
			 specific information. Under is a paragraph for each municipality of Norway, its population and its latitude and longitude. </p>
			<p> In addition to that i have also extracted the weatherforecast for each municipality. It tells the temperature, the precipitation and the humidity for the next day, tommorow.
				The website updates every 30 min so the weather data is always up to date.
